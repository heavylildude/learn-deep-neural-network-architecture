# Learn Deep Neural Network Architecture

No fluff, no notebooks — just simple lessons and scripts to get you building and understanding DNNs. Meant for people who wanna learn fast and actually remember it.

What’s inside
- Python scripts and tiny examples that demo core DNN building blocks
- Clear, tweakable code — run it, break it, fix it

Quickstart
1. git clone https://github.com/heavylildude/learn-deep-neural-network-architecture.git
2. cd learn-deep-neural-network-architecture
4. Install deps if present:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run a script:
   python examples/train_toy_model.py

Keep it chill, tweak stuff, and learn by doing.
